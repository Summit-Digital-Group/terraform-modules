| default\_tags | Tags to apply to all resources being generated | `map` | <pre>{<br>  "private": true<br>}</pre> | no |
| enable\_glacier\_transition | Enables the transition to AWS Glacier which can cause unnecessary costs for huge amount of small files | `bool` | `true` | no |
| expiration\_days | Number of days after which to expunge the objects | `number` | `90` | no |
| force\_destroy | (Optional, Default:false ) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | `bool` | `false` | no |
| glacier\_transition\_days | Number of days after which to move the data to the glacier storage tier | `number` | `60` | no |
| ignore\_public\_acls | Set to `false` to disable the ignoring of public access lists on the bucket | `bool` | `true` | no |
| kms\_master\_key\_arn | The AWS KMS master key ARN used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of sse\_algorithm as aws:kms. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the sse\_algorithm is aws:kms | `string` | `""` | no |
| lifecycle\_prefix | Prefix filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `string` | `""` | no |

| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan.
